window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Two teams of pipe-hitting special-operations Marines. A tribe knit tight as steel cable. One Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsman, struggling to find his place and keep the others alive. And everything at the end of the world exploding spectacularly at all times...</b></p> <p>The world’s last nuclear supercarrier, its support ships, and its Marine Raider guardians have survived the first months of post-apocalypse. But now they must keep their 7,500 souls fed, their non-nuclear vessels fueled, and their honor clean. They must also decide if they should risk everything by coming to the aid of beleaguered American troops in contact, in the most remote combat outpost in the world. Their lonely battles and struggles will take them from the teeming slums off the west coast of India, to the world’s tallest building in Dubai, to an idyllic desert-island paradise they can briefly call home, and finally into the unforgiving heights and impossible decisions of the Hindu Kush.</p> <p>Brotherhood, sacrifice, survival; dead men walking. But hope never dies. <b>ARISEN.</b></p>";
