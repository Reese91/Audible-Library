window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Allies and enemies grow their forces....</b></p> <p>As the galaxy marches headlong toward the greatest threat to peace since the Savage Wars, the flames are lit in the most unlikely of places.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Trapped inside a Savage mini hulk, Prisma faces a future where little is as she expected it would be, and a past that is even more troubling than she knew. Aboard a Cybar ship, Andien Broxin fights for her life with the most unlikely of allies at her side. And on the Kimbrin home world, Masters joins a Legion Special Operations Group tasked with checking a resurgent MCR…only to find himself embroiled in the flashpoint that will again plunge the galaxy into war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Goth Sullus has fallen. Tyrus Rechs is a memory. But those who are enemies of both men are now set to step forth and reveal themselves on the galactic stage — unless the Republic, and the Legion, can answer the call to sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>The lines of battle converge in this midpoint of Galaxy’s Edge Season 2!</b>&nbsp;</p>";
