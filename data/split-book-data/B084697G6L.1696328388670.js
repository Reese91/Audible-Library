window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The first story ever told left a scar on the skin of the universe, with its characters doomed to an endless cycle of reincarnation and death. Trapped by his enemies, Daniel Faust - magician, mobster, and newly-minted knight of hell - has been cast in the role of the eternal Thief. Now, the story is dead-set on writing his final chapter, the one that ends with a knife in his back.</p> <p>The curse can’t be broken without tracking down the original Thief. The truth is buried beneath the legacy of a long-dead stage magician and a cache of occult relics from the 1940s, but Daniel and his crew aren’t the only hunters on this trail: So is a deadly new contender who blends sorcery with science, armed with a link to Daniel’s past - and a cult he thought he had destroyed long ago.</p> <p>The doomsday clock is ticking, and more than Daniel’s own life is at stake. To save the day, he’ll have to pull off the most daring heist of his criminal career, stealing a priceless treasure from a reality-bending madman, or die trying.</p>";
