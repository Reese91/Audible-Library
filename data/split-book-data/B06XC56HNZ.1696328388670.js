Hank makes do by working odd jobs, but he isn't sure how long those, or the city, can last. </p> <p>However, there are still some people trying to scratch out a (dis)honest living on Belvaille. Hank concocts a plan to save the city: steal from the countless transports and freighters that pass through the System. </p> <p>In the meantime, Hank falls in with a tough crowd of freedom fighters who seem determined to overthrow the government. The team goes on exceedingly dangerous assignments, with Hank taking the brunt of the danger. </p> <p>As if things weren't bad enough, the Navy set up residence in the System, a powerful alien dignitary is scheduled to arrive, and Hank's absurdly-competent butler states that his robotic species may declare war on Hank's home. </p> <p>It's up to Hank to fix the problems, find out who is doing what and why, and to try and earn a little cash in the process. </p>";
