He's buried his enemies and more than a few friends along the way.&nbsp;</p> <p>If there's one thing a modern-day sorcerer knows for certain, though, it's that the past never stays buried forever.&nbsp;</p> <p>Now he's running on ice, juggling his responsibilities as a mob boss with his dubious \"gift\" of a knighthood in the courts of hell, defending territory in two worlds at once.&nbsp;</p> <p>It's a bad time for unfinished business to come back and haunt him, forcing him to confront his tortured history and the family he left behind. It's an even worse time for his surviving foes to join forces and take deadly aim at Faust's throne. Toss in a syndicate operative from a parallel world, a deranged, half-demon assassin hungry for a duel, and the shadowy machinations of the King of Worms, and the stage is set for a showdown under the neon lights of Vegas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Vultures are circling, and only the magician with the quickest wits - and the fastest trigger finger - will survive.</p>";
