window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Galaxy's Edge, Part IV </i>contains <i>Turning Point </i>through to the end of <i>Message for the Dead</i>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Fight to win. Survive the future.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the galaxy in turmoil, the Legion initiates Article Nineteen, a hard reset designed to halt the corruption and ineptitude that continues to spill forth from the Galactic Core. But when the House of Reason aligns itself with the bloodthirsty zhee extremists, the Legion has no choice but to commit to a savage campaign of Total War.&nbsp;</p> <p>As Legion Commander Keller attempts to coax the Republic and Black Fleet into a winner-take-all battle at the heart of the Galactic Core, Wraith uncovers secrets from Tyrus Rechs’s past. Determined to liberate his crew from the clutches of a dormant fleet controlled by a hostile AI, the soldier-turned-rogue comes face to face with the galaxy’s greatest threat.&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, Captain Chhun and Victory Squad follow intelligence that could land a powerful blow against Goth Sullus and his fledgling empire, and Exo and Wraith, in an tenuous alliance, move toward a slumbering fleet that could permanently alter the delicate balance of power among Legion, Republic, and Empire - or could just as easily eradicate the galaxy altogether.&nbsp;</p> <p>Chhun and Kill Team Victory find themselves taking on new roles inside the Legion, and the fight for control of the Galactic Republic hits its zenith with the arrival of the malevolent Cybar.</p>";
