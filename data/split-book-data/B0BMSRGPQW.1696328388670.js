window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>It all ends here.</b></p> <p>Every decision, battle, triumph, and heartache has led the galaxy to this moment.</p> <p>The Republic is spun wildly into sudden war as Gomarii slavers, in overwhelming numbers, strike on behalf of their Savage allies. The battle is fiercest on a newly rediscovered world: Earth.</p> <p>But galactic war is only the symptom of an older, deeper, and far more dangerous conflict. Now, Keel and Ravi must work frantically to assemble the warriors needed to withstand an ancient threat, and Prisma must wrestle to control her own inner darkness. While on the front lines, Death’s grim specter comes for Chhun and Victory Company.</p> <p>For once again, a Legion stands steadfast before the void.</p> <p><i>KTF Part Two </i>marks the end of Galaxy’s Edge: Season Two, and of the expansive story arc that began long ago with Legionnaire. Listen with caution, for here is where the characters you have come to know and love will meet their ultimate fates.</p> <p><i>Includes special notes from the authors.</i></p>";
