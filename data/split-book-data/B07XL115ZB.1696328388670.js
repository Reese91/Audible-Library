window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The war to end all wars is a spark away from engulfing the world in conflict and death. With super-weapons designed for Armageddon, world leaders preach restraint, but prepare to fight. </b>&nbsp;</p> <p>Oryan Jeckstadt is born into slavery - the result of an emperor who secretly punishes his enemies with a fate worse than death. He is thrust into a brutal, but wildly popular, sport with participants known as Centauri. Knowing his father’s freedom is at stake, he determines to be the best in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>After being orphaned, Elesya Celeste trains as a Centauri. Constantly placed in Oryan’s shadow, she strives not just to outshine him, but to eclipse him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Unknown to them, powerful forces are setting them up to alter the destiny of the world. Some want them to save it and others to burn it down. Who to trust remains a mystery.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the uneasy peace disintegrates, countries use Centauri victories as political influence. In this high-stakes environment, Oryan and Celeste are torn apart even as they are brought together.</p>";
