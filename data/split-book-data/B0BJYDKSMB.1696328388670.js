Now he’s on life support, and the occult relic keeping him tethered to this world is counting down the last seconds to midnight.</p> <p>That’s the good news. The bad news is, he just woke up in hell.</p> <p>Marooned, lost, and hunted in an endless city of the damned, Daniel is racing against time. If he can’t make it back to his body before the clock runs out, he’ll be trapped in the netherworld forever. A host of enemies stand in his way. Some are desperate to silence him. Others, ghosts etched in blood and gun-smoke, are hungry for payback.
