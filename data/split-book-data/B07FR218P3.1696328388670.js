window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A war older than the nation. An enemy with agents at every turn. An ancient foe with an offer of peace.</p> <p>The alliance with the Elfin Warriors has allowed the US government’s supernatural forces, the Omicron Branch, to hold the line against the demons and take the war to the Vampire Familias, defeating them in battle and reclaiming their resources.</p> <p>Victory against the vampires, however, leaves David White with a moral dilemma as he captures an entire convoy of freshly turned vampires: beyond saving, but innocent of their species’ crimes. Duty only allows one fate for them - but then an ancient vampire arrives to negotiate for their freedom.</p> <p>Letting them go drags David into the middle of a political nightmare as the Omicron Branch must decide which is more important: Omicron’s authority and revenge for their dead or the very Constitution and people they are sworn to defend.</p>";
