window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Trust nothing. Challenge everything. Survive, if you can.</p> <p>In the chilling dawn of a near-future world, gene hackers, armed with AI and CRISPR's deadly precision, unleash wave after wave of engineered diseases. With food dwindling and trust eroding, nations spiral into authoritarian chaos, battling an unseen enemy while rampant disinformation corrodes the very fabric of society.</p> <p>Millions, once productive citizens, now languish in their homes, awaiting meager government assistance checks. They peer through windows, fear in their eyes, dreading the ever-present virus police who, with a blast from their notorious Burn Boxes, cleanse the world one contaminated victim at a time.</p> <p>Amid this tempest of societal decay stands Noah Blanks, an ordinary man burdened with the responsibility of his mortgage and the health of his cherished grandpa. For him, hope is a distant memory of a saner world. But when the virus police arrive at his doorstep, forcibly hauling Grandpa out into the street and turning him to ash within the steel walls of a Burn Box, Noah's passive wait for a better world ignites into an urgent need for action.</p> <p><i>Burn Box</i> is more than a survival story. It's an exploration into the depths of humanity in a world teetering on the edge. Can Noah muster the courage to defy this twisted order, or will he be swallowed by the fiery abyss of the dystopian terror?</p>";
